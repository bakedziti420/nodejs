# NodeJS

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

JavaScript has been a computer language exclusive to the browser; that is, until Node was developed. Using Node's environment, we can use JavaScript as a general purpose language for any computer process.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

* Explain what Node.js is & why it exists
* Compare and contrast Node's API with the DOM's API
* Spin up a simple web server using node
* Use organize code into modules and require it where necessary

### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

* Navigate the terminal
* Have a proficiency in JavaScript


## Closing Thoughts
<!--
- review objectives & hierarchy of importance
- look ahead & link to future workshops
- clarify expectations and what developers should know by now
- reiterate “the why” with a perspective of your intentions
- create an active recall
- Check for understanding
